1. Open the file in read mode.
2. Initialize a dictionary to store the sum and similarity id for each line, and initialize the similarity id to 1.
3. Iterate through each line in the file.
4. Split the line by ',' and convert each value to an integer.
5. Calculate the sum of the values.
6. Check if the sum is already present in the dictionary.
7. If it is, increment the count and set the similarity id for this line to the id for the sum.
8. If the sum is not present in the dictionary, add it with a count of 1 and the current similarity id, and increment the similarity id.
9. After all lines have been processed, print the sums and similarity ids.
